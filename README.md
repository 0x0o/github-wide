# Wide GitHub

Userstyle for making all of GitHub completely fluid.

### Why

Well, we just shipped split diffs—hell yeah!—and now only part of the site is fluid. This makes it all fluid with just a bunch of CSS.

### How to use

* Chrome: https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/stylish/fjnbnpbmkenffdnngjfgmeleoegfcffe?hl=en
* Firefox: https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/stylish/ (be sure to place the CSS inside the `@-moz-document domain("twitter.com")` block)
* Safari: http://code.grid.in.th/

Copy-pasta the styles from `github-wide.css` into a new userstyle in your favorite browser. Be sure to specify that it apply to sites beginning with `https://github.com/*`.
